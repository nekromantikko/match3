# Match 3

A small match 3 game using Unity and UniRx where you match donuts, for UniRx practice/experiment. My design philosophy with this was to keep the game logic state separate from the rendering state, allowing the game to advance in discrete steps while the animations are smooth. Graphics are simple and there is no win condition, this was mostly just me trying to wrap my head around reactive extensions in a week. It's not a style I usually code in, but I can see it working for puzzle games like this.
